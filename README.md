# 🎯 TikTools - Auto TikTok Views & Likes

A simple script to automate **views** and **likes** on TikTok posts using panel API.  
Created just for fun and educational purposes — not for abuse or spamming.

---

> ⚠️ **Note**: Auto likes may not appear instantly.  
> It could take a few hours — sometimes even a full day — before likes are visible on your post.

>If you don't see a "Success add views/likes" result,
or if there is no update in views/likes count,
don't worry — the views/likes will still be delivered within a few hours,
sometimes even up to a day.
Please understand that this is a free tool 😊

>Only use post links from TikTok Mobile/Lite app,
such as: vm.tiktok.com/... or vt.tiktok.com/...
